Subject: Internship Summary ‚Äì ADAP Summer 2025 (Palak & Myself)

Dear [Manager's Name],

As we conclude our 8-week internship under the Advanced Data Analytics Program (ADAP), I wanted to share a brief summary of the work Palak and I completed during this time.

1. Data Exercises
As part of the ADAP data exercise initiative, I worked on two key analyses:

Debit Spend Analysis: Focused on merchant segmentation by total debit spend and identifying underexplored sub-categories. The goal was to show how merchant-level insights can help retain and grow the customer base through balanced promotional strategies.

Small Business Analysis: Explored customer diversity and product combinations, with a specific deep dive into low customer engagement in the Nevada region.

2. Shadow Project & Domain Exposure
Under Aditi‚Äôs mentorship, I gained hands-on exposure to:

Customer segmentation strategies,

Data modeling and testing frameworks,

Logic validation,

Foundational concepts in NLP, Excel analytics, and data quality checks.

This helped me better understand how large-scale data is structured and managed in banking.

3. Main Project Work
RS Dashboard Automation
Palak and I developed four dashboards:

Two built from scratch using raw data and self-identified metrics, later refined through stakeholder feedback.

Two enhanced from existing dashboards, updated based on new requirements and prepared for production (expected to go live by August).

We met tight deadlines, investigated data discrepancies, and supported stakeholders in improving reporting accuracy.

PPT Automation Feasibility
We explored automating PowerPoint generation from multiple data sources:

Palak used Python; I used full-stack web development.

We concluded full automation isn‚Äôt feasible due to data complexity and slide formatting constraints.

We‚Äôve documented all findings and shared the code and report via SharePoint.

4. Training & Learning
I completed all mandatory trainings (DevelopU, Pluralsight) and reviewed core tools like SQL, Python, and Excel. I also actively participated in ADAP sessions, which deepened my understanding of analytics in banking and large-scale reporting systems.

Thank you for your guidance and support throughout the program. Please let me know if you'd like further details.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]

‚úÖ Week 7 Highlights
üîπ Main Project: Regional Services Report Automation
Palak and I completed the final updates for the Power BI dashboards assigned to us as part of the internal project.

Two key dashboards ‚Äî Visit Summary Report and BCR YoY Report ‚Äî have been finalized and are production-ready, with deployment expected by early August.

During the stakeholder meeting on Friday, a few last-minute changes were requested. We incorporated these and submitted the final versions to our project manager on July 30, 2025.

In parallel, we also prepared for our final internship project presentation.

üîπ PowerPoint Automation Task
As part of our internship deliverables, I explored full-step web automation for PowerPoint generation.

However, due to the static nature of PowerPoint and specific stakeholder constraints, the automation task posed several technical and functional limitations.

We discussed the challenges with our project manager and documented all our findings, source code, and suggestions in a shared folder ‚Äî which was then sent across to the managers for reference.

üîπ Shadow Projects
I worked on my shadow project presentation, compiling learnings from various initiatives:

CAP CSF UAT Testing

Data Migration

Branding Initiatives

Concepts like Data Cube and Natural Language Processing (NLP), which I explored independently during the internship.

‚úÖ Week 8 Highlights
üîπ Regional Services Report Automation ‚Äì New File Exploration
We received a new source file for further automation work related to regional services reporting.

Rather than building a new dashboard immediately, our focus was on analyzing the structure of the file, identifying automation opportunities, and providing suggestions for the next phase of development.

üîπ Shadow Project Presentation
I presented my compiled shadow work to the project manager, summarizing my learning journey across various strategic and technical initiatives.

I also contributed to the ADAP branding initiative, where I actively participated in discussions and shared branding ideas from my side to support the team‚Äôs creative strategy.

üîπ Main Project ‚Äì Final Stakeholder Engagement
We have one final stakeholder meeting on Friday where we'll collect any last changes or inputs.

These will be integrated promptly before the project is signed off and closed out.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges was the PowerPoint automation task, which turned out to be multidimensional and technically complex.

Palak and I drafted a complete pipeline and automation structure, but much of the implementation required highly dynamic inputs and textual generation, which exceeded the scope of a standalone intern project.

We delivered a functional base and clearly outlined what‚Äôs achievable vs. what would require a full-fledged engineering effort by a dedicated team.

üìç Next Steps
As this marks the final week (Week 8) of my internship, the upcoming steps are more reflective and transitional:

Ensure all project files and documentation are complete and accessible.

Submit the final deliverables, including the Power BI dashboards and the PowerPoint automation analysis.

Wrap up all pending tasks and organize shared folders for easy handover.

Reflect on learnings and prepare a personal takeaway summary for long-term reference.
